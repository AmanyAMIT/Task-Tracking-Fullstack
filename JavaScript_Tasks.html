            When you have lasagna in the oven, you want to know whether you can already take it out or not. <br>
            To make sure the lasagna does not burn in the oven, you usually set a timer. But sometimes you forget about
            that. <br>
            Write a function cookingStatus with that accepts the remaining time on the timer in minutes as parameter.
            The function has three possible results. <br>
            <p>If the timer shows zero, it should return 'Lasagna is done.'.</p>
            <p>If the timer shows any other number, the result should be 'Not done, please wait.'.</p>
            <p>If the function is called without a timer value, the result should be 'You forgot to set the timer.'.</p>
